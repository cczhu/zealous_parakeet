\section{The Influence of Merger Remnants Properties on Potential Explosions}

If sub-\Mch\ CO WD merger remnants indeed trigger thermonuclear detonations following post-merger viscous evolution, will these explosions resemble SNe Ia?  As noted in the introduction, SNe Ia observations and radiative transfer models for explosions are now sophisticated enough to distinguish fine details between different progenitors.  While a 3D hydrodynamic explosion model has not been run for a spun-down merger remnant, we can look at works investigating related progenitors to obtain first-order estimates.
