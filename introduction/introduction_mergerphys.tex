\section{Pre-Merger Evolution}

To preface the rest of the thesis, we briefly cover a few topics that are only mentioned in passing in subsequent chapters: what WD masses are typically involved in a CO WD binary merger, and the stability of mass transfer between WDs.

\subsection{Typical CO WD Masses}
\label{ssec:c1_cowd_massrange}

While we can roughly estimate that CO WDs masses have a range from $\sim0.4 - 1.0\,\Msun$ (Sec. \ref{sec:c1_wdmergers}), mergers between CO WDs of certain masses may statistically be more common.  Here we discuss the difficulties in determining these typical masses.

\cite{trem+16} find that the field distribution of single CO WDs is sharply peaked, with a mean mass of $\Mmean \approx 0.62\,\Msun$ and a dispersion of $\sim0.1\,\Msun$; other studies report similar \Mmean\ values ranging from $\sim0.6 - 0.65\,\Msun$ (\citealt{klei+13}, and references therein).  \citeal{vkercj10} argue that since mass transfer tends to shrink binary orbits, the progenitor systems of double WD binaries will tend to have constituents with similar masses, which minimizes the first phase of mass transfer.  Consequently, the two WDs will also have similar masses, which, na\"{i}vely, suggests a typical merging binary system would consist of two \Mmean\ WDs.

Detailed theoretical calculations using population synthesis do find close WD binaries with $\sim0.65\,\Msun$ constituents, but generally predict a population that has a wider range of masses and mass ratios (eg. \citealt{toon+14} Fig. 8, 10).  In \cite{toonnp12}, for example, the population is bimodal, with the peaks centered roughly around $0.5-0.6\,\Msun$ and $0.4-0.7\,\Msun$.  The predicted populations, however, differ between population synthesis codes, and depend on how mass loss and WD formation for single stars, the initial mass distribution of binaries on the main sequence, mass transfer and transfer stability criteria, and common envelope evolution are implemented \citep{toon+14, clae+14}.  It is therefore unclear how robust they are.

Meanwhile, spectroscopic surveys for short-period WD binaries have yielded a few dozen that will merge within a Hubble time (eg. \citealt{mars11, gian+15}).  Most of these have been discovered by the Extremely Low-Mass (ELM) WD survey (eg. \citealt{brow+10, gian+15}); its systems show a wide range of mass ratios, but since the survey targets binaries where one WD has $M\lesssim 0.3\,\Msun$, it likely does not represent the overall distribution of binaries.  Outside of ELM, few WD binaries of total mass $\gtrsim1.0\,\Msun$ are known \citep{napi+07, mars11}, at least partly because WD surface area, and therefore luminosity, decreases with mass, making massive ones more difficult to find.  \cite{badem12} deduce WD merger rates through statistical analysis of the binary WD population from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep{york+00}, but their analysis is not sensitive to mass ratio \citep{maozbb12}.  We note that the recently launched Gaia space mission \citep{carr+14} is expected to increase the number of known WDs by a factor of $10$, discovering perhaps thousands of close WD binaries in the process, and -- in concert with ground-based follow-up spectroscopy to determine masses and radial velocities -- will bring better statistics for the merging WD binary mass distribution \citep{gaen+15}.

In lieu of definitive answers above, we perform in Ch. \ref{ch:ch2} merger simulations for systems that span the range of possible CO WD masses and mass ratios, with additional mass resolution near $0.65\,\Msun$ (the \Mmean\ reported by \citealt{tremb09}).  Thereafter, we focus on a $0.625-0.65\,\Msun$ merger.  This system is of interest not only because its constituents are near \Mmean\ while its total mass is substantially below \Mch, but, from Sec. \ref{sec:c1_vkchannel} (and Ch. \ref{ch:ch2}), mergers of WDs with similar masses appear more likely to ignite fusion at their centers.\footnote{The masses are not made exactly equal, since this is improbable in nature.}

\subsection{Merger Initial Conditions and Unstable Mass Transfer}
\label{ssec:c1_stable_mass_transfer}

For all of the merger simulations we conduct in this thesis, we generate initial conditions by placing two unperturbed spherical WDs, whose rotation are unsynchronized with their orbital period, at an initial separation where the radius of the less massive WD is equal to its Roche lobe (the radius around a star within which any material is gravitational bound to the star).  Note that the less massive WD is always the first to initiate mass transfer, since by the WD mass-radius relation (eg. \citealt{kippww12} Sec. 19.6),

\eqbegin
R \propto M^{\frac{1 - n}{3 - n}} \approx M^{-1/3}
\label{eq:c1_massradiusrelation}
\eqend

\noindent (approximating the low-mass cold WD equation of state with an $n = 3/2$ polytrope), it is larger and overflows its Roche lobe first.  We therefore call the less massive WD the ``donor'' and the more massive the ``accretor'' throughout the thesis.  The use of unsynchronized WDs is discussed in Sec. \ref{ssec:c2_initcond} and \ref{ssec:c2_synchronization}.  

The use of spherical WDs, however, neglects the tidal bulges they develop close to the start of mass transfer.  Hence, in our simulations, the WDs deform and radially pulsate in response to the new potential.  The less massive WD overshoots the Roche lobe during each pulsation, resulting in an overestimate of the rate of early mass transfer.  \cite{dan+11} show that, for systems where the WD spin and orbital period are synchronized, ``accurate initial conditions'' that include tidal bulges extend the phase of mass transfer prior to the full tidal disruption of the donor by several tens of orbital periods.  It is much more difficult to accurately create tidal bulges in unsynchronized systems, and we discuss the effects of our ``approximate'' initial conditions in Sec. \ref{ssec:c2_importance_accurate_ics}.\footnote{The effect of using accurate versus approximate initial conditions on the final inspiral phase and structure of the remnant will vary between mergers.  For example, \citeauthor{dan+11} (\citeyear{dan+11}, their Fig. 9) find the maximum density and temperature of a $0.6-0.9\,\Msun$ merger remnant changes by $\sim5$ and $\sim50$\%, respectively, but \citeauthor{pakm+12sph} (\citeyear{pakm+12sph}, their Figs. 5 and 6) show few changes to the density and temperature profiles during the coalescence of a $1.0 - 1.1\,\Msun$ binary.}

Because mass transfer rates are overestimated, however, our simulations cannot predict which binaries will experience runaway mass transfer and merge -- indeed, every one of our simulations in Ch. \ref{ch:ch2} does so.  Whether or not mass transfer between two stars is stable has long been studied analytically and semi-analytically, and it is known that it depends critically on the mass ratio $\qm = \Md/\Ma$ between the donor star (\Md) and the accretor star (\Ma; from above, $\Ma \geq \Md$ and $\qm \leq 1$), and whether or not spin and orbital angular momentum can be efficiently coupled to each other.  We sketch a simple argument for stability below, based on derivations in \cite{marsns04} and \cite{dan+11}.

Let us first consider the case in which some dissipative process, such as tidal torquing between the donor and accretor or an accretion disk, is able to instantly return any angular momentum from the WD spin back to the orbit, thus helping to stabilize mass transfer.  The orbital angular momentum $L_\mrm{orb} = (\Ma\Md/\Mtot)\sqrt{G\Mtot a}$, where $\Mtot = \Md + \Ma$ and $a$ is the orbital separation, can be used to derive $\dot{L}_\mrm{orb}/L_\mrm{orb} = \dot{\Md}/\Md + \dot{\Ma}/\Ma - \dot{M}_\mrm{tot}/2\Mtot + \dot{a}/2a$.  We shall assume conservative mass transfer (this is backed by the simulations in Ch. \ref{ch:ch2} and \ref{ch:ch3}, which show less than $1$\% of stellar material becomes unbound), meaning $\dot{\Ma} = -\dot{\Md}$ and $\dot{M}_\mrm{tot} = 0$.  Since the system is closed, $\dot{L}_\mrm{orb} = 0$.  Putting these together gives us

\eqbegin
\frac{\dot{L}_\mrm{orb}}{L_\mrm{orb}} = (1 - \qm)\frac{\dot{\Md}}{\Md} + \frac{\dot{a}}{2a} = 0.
\label{eq:c1_adotovera}
\eqend

\noindent We use \cite{pacz71}'s estimate for the Roche lobe of \Md, $R_L \approx 0.46a(\Md/\Mtot)^{1/3}$, valid for $\qm \lesssim 1$ \citep{eggl83}.  Differentiating and using Eqn. \ref{eq:c1_adotovera}, we obtain

\eqbegin
\frac{\dot{R}_\mrm{L}}{R_\mrm{L}} = 2(\qm- \frac{5}{6})\frac{\dot{\Md}}{\Md}.
\label{eq:c1_rochedotoverroche}
\eqend

\noindent For mass transfer to be stable, \Rd\ must contract more quickly (or expand more slowly) than $R_L$, i.e. $\dot{R}_\mrm{d}/\Rd < \dot{R}_\mrm{L}/R_\mrm{L}$.  From Eqn. \ref{eq:c1_massradiusrelation}, $\dot{R}_\mrm{d}/\Rd = -\dot{\Md}/3\Md$; combining this with Eqn. \ref{eq:c1_rochedotoverroche}, we obtain the stability criterion $2(\qm- 5/6) < -1/3$, or:

\eqbegin
\qm < \frac{2}{3}.
\label{eq:c1_qcrit}
\eqend

\noindent Most of the systems we simulate fall well outside of the stable regime, but a number (such as the $0.4 - 1.0\,\Msun$ merger in Ch. \ref{ch:ch2}) do satisfy this, and na\"{i}vely should not merge.

In the case where spin and orbital angular momentum coupling is instead negligible -- which is the case if the accretion stream does not form a disk but rather directly impacts the accretor \citep{nele+01} -- a similar analysis can be performed, using total angular momentum $L = L_\mrm{orb} + L_\mrm{spin} = (\Ma\Md/\Mtot)\sqrt{G\Mtot a} + L_\mrm{spin}$, from which we may derive $\dot{L}/L_\mrm{orb} = \dot{\Ma}/\Ma + \dot{\Md}/\Md - \dot{\Mtot}/2\Mtot + \dot{a}/2a + \dot{L}_\mrm{spin}/L_\mrm{orb}$.  Following \cite{marsns04}, we assume only the spin of the accretor is relevant, and use \cite{verbr88}'s representation of the accretor spin-up from direct impact accretion, $\dot{L}_\mrm{spin} = -\dot{\Md}\sqrt{G\Ma R_h}$ ($\dot{\Md}$ is negative).  $R_h$ is the effective radius of the matter transferred onto the accretor, and the ratio $r_h = R_h/a$ is given by a fitting formula: $r_h \approx 0.0883 - 0.04858\log(\qm) + 0.11489{\log}^2(\qm) + 0.020475{\log}^3(\qm)$, valid for all plausible WD binary mass ratios \citep{verbr88}.  Dividing $\dot{L}_\mrm{spin}$ by $L_\mrm{orb}$ to obtain $\dot{L}_\mrm{spin}/L_\mrm{orb} = -\sqrt{(1 + \qm)r_h}(\dot{\Md}/\Md)$, and assuming conservative mass transfer as before ($\dot{\Ma} = -\dot{\Md}$, $\dot{M}_\mrm{tot} = 0$, and $\dot{L} = 0$), we obtain

\eqbegin
\frac{\dot{a}}{a} = 2\left(\qm- 1 + \sqrt{(1 + \qm)r_h}\right)\frac{\dot{\Md}}{\Md}.
\label{eq:c1_adotovera2}
\eqend

\noindent Using the same argument that gave us Eqn. \ref{eq:c1_qcrit}, this reduces to

\eqbegin
\qm- \frac{2}{3} + \sqrt{(1 + \qm)r_h} < 0,
\label{eq:c1_qcrit2}
\eqend

\noindent which, solved numerically, is

\eqbegin
\qm\lesssim 0.2,
\label{eq:c1_qcrit3}
\eqend

\noindent well below any mass ratio for a CO WD binary (Sec. \ref{ssec:c1_cowd_massrange}).  Eqns. \ref{eq:c1_qcrit} or \ref{eq:c1_qcrit3} represent the upper and lower-bounds of mass transfer stability, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:c1_stability} (from \citealt{marsns04}): a binary with $\qm > 2/3$ will experience unstable mass transfer even with perfect angular momentum coupling, while a binary with $\qm \lesssim 0.2$ will always be stable, even with no coupling.  The critical $\qm$ for an imperfect coupling will fall somewhere between these two.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Regions of stable and unstable mass transfer for the WD merger parameter space from \citeauthor{marsns04} (\citeyear{marsns04}; their Fig. 1).  $M_1$ is \Ma\, and $M_2$ is \Md.  The upper dashed line is a more accurate estimate for Eqn. \ref{eq:c1_qcrit} (that accounts for the accretor's moment of inertia), and the lower dashed one that for Eqn. \ref{eq:c1_qcrit2}.  The solid ``Direct/Disc'' line represents the transition between direct impact and disk accretion.  Dotted lines represent the boundary between stable and unstable mass transfer when the tidal synchronization timescale $\tau_\mrm{s}$ is $1000$, $10$ and $0.1\,\mrm{yr}$.}
\label{fig:c1_stability}
\end{figure}

The question then becomes which stability criterion better represents mass transfer in WD binaries.  In the absence of other sources of spin-orbit coupling, this is determined solely by whether disk or direct impact accretion occurs.  Following \cite{lubos75}, \cite{nele+01} determines when one transitions into the other by calculating the point where the minimum radius reached by the accretion stream becomes larger than the accretor; the corresponding critical surface in the merger mass parameter space is plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:c1_stability}.  For $0.4 \leq \Ma \leq 1.0$, the line falls around $\qm = 0.15$, below even Eqn. \ref{eq:c1_qcrit3}.

Tides within the WDs can substitute for disks for spin-orbit coupling.  While traditional estimates of the spin-orbit synchronization timescale in WD binaries ranges from $\tau_{S} \sim 10^{12}$ yr for radiative damping to $\tau_{S} \sim 10^{15}$ yr for molecular viscosity \citep{marsns04}, other sources of dissipation, such as turbulent viscosity \citep{mochl89}, may lead to much shorter $\tau_{S}$.  Recent work \citep{fulll12, burk+13, fulll14} show resonant coupling between tidal forces and stellar pulsations favor a much shorter $\tau_\mrm{s}$ (though exactly how short remains unclear; \citealt{fulll14}).  Semi-analytical calculations \citep{marsns04,gokhpf07, kremsk15}, however, suggest that even for $\tau_\mrm{s}$ as small as $10\,\mrm{yr}$, all the systems we consider in this thesis should still experience unstable mass transfer and merge.  All these systems also merge in simulations that more accurately model the binary at the onset of mass transfer \citep{dan+11, dan+12}, and so we proceed under the notion that all our binaries should merge.  We note that there is evidence \citep{shen15, brow+16} that even He - CO WD binaries with extremely low $\qm$ do so as well.
