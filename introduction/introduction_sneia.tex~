\section{The Mystery of Type Ia Supernovae}

The outcome of the merger of two CO WDs is uncertain in part because during the merger temperatures do not become hot enough to ignite significant carbon fusion (e.g., \citealt{loreig09}, \citeal{loreig09} hereafter), except possibly for masses above $\sim\!0.9\,M_\odot$ \citep{pakm+11,pakm+12}.  Hence, the final fate depends on subsequent evolution, in which differential rotation is dissipated, the remnant disk accretes, and the whole remnant possibly spins down.  Due to these processes, the remnant could be compressed and heated, which, if it happens faster than the thermal timescale, would lead to increased temperatures and thus potentially to ignition.  

So far, efforts have focused on merging binaries with total mass $M>\Mch$.  The end result of such mergers is believed to be either stable off-center carbon ignition, which would turn the merger remnant into an oxygen-neon WD and possibly eventually result in accretion-induced collapse \citep{saion98}, or slow accretion, which allows the remnant to stay cool and eventually ignite at high central density \citep{yoonpr07}.  Less massive mergers were usually thought to result in more massive, rapidly rotating CO WDs \citep{segrcm97,kube+10}, but more recently it has been realized these might eventually become hot enough to ignite (\citealt{vkercj10}, \citeal{vkercj10} hereafter; \citealt{shen+12,schw+12}).  Indeed, \citeal{vkercj10} argue that type Ia supernovae result generally from mergers of CO WDs with similar masses, independent of whether or not their total mass exceeds \Mch\ (see below).  For all these studies, the conclusions on whether and where ignition takes place depend critically on the structure of the merger remnnant.

The merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) originally in a short-period binary is estimated (eg. \citealt{badem12}) to occur about once every century in a Milky Way-like galaxy, making the products of such events common throughout the universe.  They have been held responsible for producing a variety of stars with strange properties, including helium-burning sdOB stars \citep{saioj00, justph11}, RCrB stars (eg. \citealt{webb84, clay+07, clay13}), and massive and highly magnetized WDs (eg. \citealt{segrcm97, garc+12, kule+13}) that could resemble the hot DQ WDs (eg. \citealt{dunlc15}), Dunlap and Clements in preparation).  They may, however, also be responsible for spectacular transient events including accretion-induced collapses (eg. \citealt{saion85, abdi+10}) and type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia; eg. \citealt{howe11, hill+13, maozmn14}).  Determining the final outcome of a particular merger requires an understanding of the detailed dynamics of the merging process, which cannot directly be seen using current observational capabilities.  Thus, studies of merger physics have primarily utilized hydrodynamic simulations.


\subsection{Properties and Traditional Formation Channels of SNe Ia}
\label{ssec:old_typeia}

\subsection{Traditional Shortfalls}

The traditional method of generating an SN Ia involves slow accretion of material over $\sim10^6$ yr onto the CO WD from either a non-degenerate companion or an accretion disk following a merger with another WD.  As the CO WD approaches the Chandrasekhar mass \Mch, its central density becomes sufficiently high that the rate of energy generation from pycnonuclear carbon-carbon nuclear fusion exceeds that at which neutrino cooling can transport it away.  The resulting increase in central entropy establishes a convection zone that transports the heat of the nuclear burning region to much of the WD interior.  The WD is highly degenerate, however, and does not expand and cool in response to heating.  Instead, a nuclear runaway ensues over the next thousand years as the WD grows ever hotter, a period of evolution referred to as the ``simmering phase''.  \Mch\ WDs eventually become hot enough that the timescale for nuclear burning becomes shorter than the dynamical time -- we refer to this as ``dynamical burning'' -- at which point an explosion becomes inevitable.

%Most proposed mechanisms involve mass transfer from a companion body, and are commonly divided into three categories based on the nature of that body: ``single-degenerate channels'' \citep{none} where the CO WD slowly accretes material from an H-rich companion, ``double-degenerate channels'' \citep{none} where the CO WD accretes material (slowly or rapidly, depending on the mechanism) from another CO-WD, and ``double detonation'' channels \citep{none} where the CO WD accretes helium and then a detonation happens.Mechanisms can also be subdivided into ``prompt'' and ``delayed'' categories, where prompt means it explodes immediately.

%This scenario is beset by two major issues (\citealt{vkercj10}, henceforth \citeal{vkercj10}; \citealt{vker13}) that have not been resolved that have not been resolved (or indeed may have even been exacerbated) despite the increasing quality of observations and theoretical/numerical models in the last few decades.  The first is that, in order to match the observed SN Ia rate, $\sim1$\% of all WDs formed (of any composition and regardless of binarity) must produce SNe Ia (\citeal{vkercj10}, \citealt{vker13}).  Compared to this relatively large number, there is an apparent paucity of CO WDs that can reach \Mch.  In hydrogen-accreting single degenerate systems, efficient growth of the CO WD appears only achievable if the accretion rate is $\sim10^{-7}$ \Msun\ yr$^{-1}$, making these systems prominent supersoft x-ray emittors.  Surveys for supersoft sources \citep{none} suggest they are an order of magnitude too rare to be the primary source of SNe Ia (though see discussion on the ``spin-up/spin-down'' model; \citealt{none}).  Meanwhile, both binary population synthesis \citep{none} and WD binary surveys \citep{badem12} estimate that the merger rate of CO - CO WD binaries with total mass greater than $\sim\Mch$ falls short of the SN Ia rate by a factor of at least a few.  The second is BLAH  Indeed,   Also mention sub-luminous and superluminous SNe Ia.

This scenario is beset by several issues (\citealt{vkercj10}, henceforth \citeal{vkercj10}, and references therein).  The first is that, in order to match the observed SN Ia rate, $\sim1$\% of all WDs formed (of any composition and regardless of binarity) must produce SNe Ia \citep{prichs08, vker13}.  Compared to this relatively large number, there is an apparent paucity -- by a factor of at least a few  -- of both CO WDs accreting efficiently from non-degenerate companions \citep{none} and merging CO - CO WD binaries whose total mass exceeds \Mch\ \citep{badem12}.  The second is the difficulty for the thermonuclear explosion of an \Mch\ mass CO WD to replicate the properties and population-level trends of ordinary SN Ia (such as the \cite{phil93} relation between peak luminosity and brightness decay time), without appealing to an \textit{ad-hoc} deflagration-to-detonation transition \citep{khok91}.  Recent years have also revealed substantial populations of sub and superluminous SNe Ia (eg. \cite{none}).  If these SNe are also generated by exploding CO WDs, then either the classical scenario above is robust enough to explain them, or alternative channels to exploding WDs must also occur in nature.

%The second is the difficulty for the thermonuclear explosion of an \Mch\ mass CO WD to replicate the nucleosynthetic products and ejecta velocities of ordinary SN Ia, as well as their \cite{phil93} relation between peak luminosity and brightness decay time, without appealing to an \textit{ad-hoc} deflagration-to-detonation transition \citep{khok91}.  The transition would also have to be consistent with the correlation between the luminosity of an SN Ia and the age of its stellar environment \citep{none}.  Recent years have revealed substantial populations of sub and superluminous SNe Ia that deviate from the Phillips relation.  If these SNe are indeed generated by exploding WDs (SNe Ia resembling SN 2005E may be due to core-collapse \citep{none}), then either the classical pycnonuclear scenario above must be robust enough to explain them, or alternative channels to exploding WDs must also occur in nature.

The challenge posed by these issues has spurred research into alternative scenarios where CO WDs with masses significantly \textit{below} \Mch\ can also explode.  This obviously bolsters substantially the number of CO WDs that could be SN Ia progenitors.  Sub-\Mch\ explosions also do not need to appeal to the deflagration-to-detonation transition: simulations of pure detonations of sub-\Mch\ CO WDs \citep{shig+92, sim+10} are competitive with \Mch\ explosion models for reproducing the light curves and spectra of SNe Ia \citep{none}.  Some SN Ia population trends, most notably the Phillips relation and the correlation between SN Ia luminosity and host stellar population age (eg. \cite{none}), can also naturally be explained by exploding CO WDs with a range of masses (\citeal{vkercj10}).

\subsection{Brave New Channels}

\section{The \citeal{vkercj10} SN Ia Channel}

%The advantages of this channel are that it accounts for the absence of direct evidence for stellar companions, the observed SN Ia rate, and the dependence of SN Ia peak luminosity on the age of the host stellar population (because lower-mass merger constituents take longer to form).  Since pure detonations of sub-\Mch\ CO WDs produce light curves very similar to observed SNe Ia \citep{shig+92,sim+10}, it also removes the need for imposed deflagration-to-detonation transitions. 

%Important questions, however, remain, including what fraction of mergers leads to remnants that are hot near the center (in highly degenerate conditions), how the subsequent viscous phase proceeds in detail, whether ignition leads to a detonation, and whether the detonation of a remant that may still rotate and be surrounded by a disk would produce an event similar to an SN Ia.  

Hydrodynamic simulations \citep{loreig09} suggest that a $0.6-0.6\,\Msun$ merger never achieves temperatures high enough to ignite fusion (more recent work (eg. \citep{pakm+11, dan+12}) suggest $\sim0.9\,\Msun$ as the minimum accreting WD mass for this to occur); moreover, the remnant central density, $\sim2.5\times10^6\,\gcc$, is too low to produce \Ni\ in an explosion.  Following coalescence, however, the remnant, which is differentially rotating, enters a period of rapid angular momentum redistribution due to hydrodynamically or magnetically-mediated viscosity.  Using the standard $\alpha$-viscosity prescription \cite{shaks73} -- i.e. $\nu = \alpha c_s H_P$, where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $H_P$ the pressure scale height -- the timescale for viscous evolution can be estimated as

\begin{eqnarray}
t_\mrm{visc} &=& \frac{R_\mrm{disk}^2}{\nu} \sim \frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{R_\mrm{disk}^2}{H_P^2}\taudyn \nonumber \\
			&\sim& 3\times10^4\,\mrm{s}\left(\frac{10^{-2}}{\alpha}\right)\left(\frac{R_\mrm{disk}/H_P}{10}\right)^2\left(\frac{R_\mrm{disk}}{10^9\,\mrm{cm}}\right)^{3/2}\left(\frac{M_\mrm{enc}}{1\,\Msun}\right)^{-1/2},
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $M_\mrm{enc}$ is we have used $\taudyn \approx H_P/c_s$ and inserted a fiducial viscosity and typical numbers for remnants \citep{shen+12}.  Thus the vast majority of the remnant's angular momentum is transported away, and the remnant (including its disk) loses its rotational support against gravity, over a period $\sim10^4\,\mrm{s}$.\footnote{This is notably in contrast to earlier work (eg. \citep{nomoi85, yoonpr07}) that assume any rotationally-supported material will slowly accrete onto the dense core of the remnant at a near-Eddington mass accretion rate of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-5}\,\Msun\pyr$.  Remnants are prone to magnetic instability (Sec. \ref{sec:intro_pme}), and will almost certainly evolve over the much shorter timescale given by the $\alpha$-viscosity estimate.}  This loss of rotational support combined with increasing weight from newly accreted disk material leads to compression and heating of the remnant core.  Since $\sim10^4\,\mrm{s}$ is far shorter than either the neutrino cooling timescale of $\taunu \sim 10^3\,\mrm{yr}$ or the thermal adjustment timescale of $\sim10^4\,\mrm{yr}$ \citep{shen+12}, compressional heating is adiabatic, and \citeal{vkercj10} estimates that for the $0.6-0.6\,\Msun$ remnant it leads both the central density and temperature to increase to $\gtrsim1.5\times10^7\,\gcc$ and $\gtrsim10^9\,\mrm{K}$, at which point a carbon nuclear runaway is inevitable.

Thus, the \citeal{vkercj10} channel is both attractive for its many advantages and plausible given the order-of-magnitude estimates above.  Investigating whether these estimates hold under detailed scrutiny, and to determine which, if any, systems in the CO WD binary parameter space could follow the channel, is the purpose of this PhD thesis.
