For Marten/Stephen:

RCB and sdO stars are both purported to form from the merger from a CO and He WD and a post-sdB and He WD, respectively.  To first order, however, mergers of both types of systems should form fairly similar remnants (at least in the limit where a post-sdB has lots of CO and very little He).  What's the difference between the sdO formation channel and the RCB formation channel?  Ex. Saio and Jeffery 2002 is cited in Justham et al. 2011, but suggest in their abstract evolution from an EHE to an RCB.

Clayton et al give a 150 solar mass accretion rate, and only manage to get stable He burning.  Is it because their analytical model assumes certain things?  Do they simply assume that an atmosphere is created?  And why do they cite Guerrero?  Guerrero never does anything involving accretion.

What are "iron peak elements"?  Do they include Ti44?

What is the term used for the combined merger and stable mass transfer rate?

Brown et al. give crazy numbers?


Phil: if convection keeps the temperature (entropy?) profile approximately adiabatic, shouldn't a nuclear runaway lead to an explosion only if the runaway occurred quickly?  If so, what are novae? - perhaps a more fitting question is "what is the height of the convective zone?"

I would imagine the dynamical time is related to the sound crossing time - why is it instead commonly defined as a free-fall time?






Extremely super-Eddington accretion rates. as cited by \citeauthor{clay+09}, should also simply result in hydrostatic burning, as the accretion stream will generally be hot and will not be very dense.  From \cite{loreig09} we obtain a disk temperature of approximately $10^7$ K for a 0.3 - 0.5 {\Msun} He-CO merger, and let us assume an accretion rate of 100 {\Msun} yr$^{-1}$.  Using Figs. 1 and 2 from \cite{bild+07} (reproduced as Fig. \ref{bildstenfig}), we determine that the amount of mass accreted before He ignition will be less than $10^{-3}$ {\Msun}, meaning that $t_{\mathrm{nuclear}} < t_{\mathrm{dynamical}}$, and therefore hydrodynamic burning is never achieved, and the He layer simply expands to accomodate the additional energy generated.
