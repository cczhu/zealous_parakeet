\section{The Panopoly of Stellar Mergers}
\label{sec:c1_stellarmergers}

Approximately two out of every three stars are born into a binary system.  A substantial fraction of these stars will interact, some due to their orbital separation at birth, while others following the expansion of one or both constituent stars as they evolve off of the main sequence.  These interactions primarily take form as mass transfer between the stars \citep{yung05}, and if mass transfer becomes unstable (increases exponentially over time), it ends with the violent coalescence of the two stars into one.  These stellar mergers, like other forms of binary interaction, disrupt single star evolution and create merged products, or ``merger remnants'', with unusual properties including blue stragglers (eg. \citealt{andrpt06, knigs09}), luminous blue variables \citep{justpv14}, subdwarf OB and R Coronae Borealis (RCrB) stars.

Mergers also liberate tremendous amounts of energy and eject significant amounts of mass, giving rise to a cornucopia of electromagnetic (and gravitational-wave) transients ranging from luminous red novae (from the merger of two (post-) main-sequence stars; eg. V838 Monocerotis and V1309 Scorpii \citep{tyle+11, nandil14}) to short gamma-ray bursts (from two neutron stars; eg. \citealt{ross15}) and the gravitational wave outburst from coalescing stellar-mass black holes (as recently found by the LIGO detector; \citealt{ligo16}).  Indeed, with current deep and short-cadence optical/near-infrared survey projects such as the Palomar Transient Factory \citep{rau+09} and Pan-STARRS \citep{kais+10} continuing to uncover more rare and even hitherto-unknown transients, and the ambitious Large Synoptic Survey Telescope \citep{lsst09} under construction, a much more complete picture of merger-generated transients will form over the next decade.

\section{Mergers of Two White Dwarfs}
\label{sec:c1_wdmergers}

Stars with masses $\lesssim8-10\,\Msun$ generally end their lives as white dwarfs (WDs).  On their own, WDs are usually inert: held up against gravity by electron degeneracy pressure (eg. \cite{kippww12}, Ch. 15) and having ceased nuclear fusion, they will slowly radiate away their remaining thermal energy over billions of years if left alone.  WDs in interacting binaries, on the other hand, can receive mass and energy from their stellar companion, leading to a whole host of energetic and potentially explosive phenomena.

\subsubsection{The Formation of Double White Dwarf Binaries}

One common end-product of binary evolution is a pair of white dwarf (WDs).    These binaries are formed as a result of at least two phases of mass transfer (at least one of which is a common envelope event) during the binary's prior stellar evolution.  These mass transfer phases act to sap the orbital angular momentum of the

See text, as well as \cite{dan+12}, Sec. 2, for discussion on these choices.}
\label{fig:c1_wdbinarymasses}
\end{figure}

The mass and composition of each WD within the binary are dependent on the binary's prior evolution, and therefore are related to one another.  Broadly speaking, WDs with masses $M \lesssim 0.45\,\Msun$ are composed of helium (He), since these come from stars that had their evolution interrupted by binary interaction while on the RGB (eg. \citealt{marsdd95, nele+01, nele+01a}), before their degenerate He core became massive enough to trigger a helium flash (eg. \cite{kippww12}, Ch. 33.4).  (They could in principle also come from single stars of $\lesssim0.5\,\Msun$, but the universe is not old for any He WD to have been born this way {\charles CITATION}.)  WDs with slightly higher masses have He envelopes surrounding cores composed of carbon and oxygen (CO); \cite{dan+12} approximate the mass range of these ``hybrid WDs'' to be $0.45 \lesssim M \lesssim 0.6\,\Msun$.  From $0.6 \lesssim M \lesssim 1.1\,\Msun$ WDs are almost entirely composed of CO, with He atmospheres of $\sim10^{-2}\,\Msun$ (eg. \citealt{ibent85}).  WDs with masses $\gtrsim 1.1\,\Msun$ come from super-AGB stars (eg. \citealt{herw05}) that ignite carbon during their evolution (eg. \citealt{garc13}), and thus are composed at least partly of oxygen and neon (ONe).  

Fig. \ref{fig:c1_wdbinarymasses}, from \cite{dan+12}, summarizes these relationships for the WD binary parameter space -- in it, $M_1$ is the mass of the (more massive) primary WD, which accretes mass during the merger, and $M_2$ is the mass of the secondary, which donates mass (Sec. \ref{ssec:c1_stable_mass_transfer}).  While nature is not so clear-cut (eg. \citealt{ibent85, moros09} for CO WDs with $M\lesssim0.45\,\Msun$), these relationships are used as rules of thumb for setting WD composition for a wide range of works (\citealt{loreig09,rask+12,dan+12,dan+14,}, with slight variations between different research groups) for setting the composition).  In this thesis, we generate binaries of CO WDs with masses ranging from $0.4 - 1.0\,\Msun$ for our parameter space study of mergers in Ch. \ref{ch:ch2}.  In subsequent chapters, we are primarily interested in the the merger of two CO WDs near the median mass of field WDs, $\sim0.65\,\Msun$ (Sec. \ref{ssec:c1_cowd_massrange}).

The ratio of carbon and oxygen within CO WDs is also not particularly well-known.  In this thesis, we make the assumption that they are composed of 50\% carbon and 50\% oxygen by mass.  {\charles ADD STUFF}

\subsubsection{Orbital Angular Momentum Loss and Gravitational Wave Emission}

Following their formation, these binaries can lose orbital angular momentum through a number of of mechanisms, including gravitational radiation (eg. \citealt{XXX}), magnetic braking \citep{XXX} or the influence of a third body (eg. \citealt{katzd12}).  {\charles TIDAL EFFECTS?}  In the absence of a magnetized wind or third body, gravitational radiation is generally thought to be the dominant driver of angular momentum loss, and has a characteristic timescale of \citep{segrcm97}

\eqbegin
\tau_{\mrm{grav}} = 5 \times 10^5 \left(\frac{a}{10^5 \mrm{km}}\right)^4 \frac{\Msun}{\Ma} \frac{\Msun}{\Md} \frac{\Msun}{\Mtot}\,\mrm{yr}.
\label{eq:c1_gravtimescale}
\eqend

\noindent From this, we see that WD binaries with orbital periods on the order of hours or less will merge within a Hubble time.  It is estimated that there are on order of $10^8$ such systems in the Milky Way alone \citep{nele+01a,mars11}.  {\charles CHECK THESE VALUES!}

While inspiralling WD binaries with periods on the order of minutes are too low-frequency to be detected by Advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory \citealt{ligo+15}), they are expected to be the most numerous and dominant source of gravitational waves \citep{mars11} detected by the proposed spaceborne detector eLISA (evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna; \citealt{amar+13}), which probes the mHz frequency range.  Individual signals from thousands of WD binaries that are $\sim1\,\mrm{Myr}$ prior to merger can be individually resolved with eLISA \citep{amar+13,loreig09, dan+11}, while the numerous sources further away and at at longer orbital periods (lower frequencies) will comprised an unresolved background \cite{neleyp01,amar+13}.  Both of these will probe the WD binary population of the Milky Way without the selection biases that often trouble electromagnetic binary searches \citep{mars11}.  {\charles Note, however, that final coalescence of the WDs is over far too quickly to be detectable by eLISA.}  The energy lost to gravitational radiation also plays a negligible role during the merger, being is $\sim10^{-10}$ of the binary's binding energy (eg. \citealt{loreig09}).

\subsubsection{Merger Outcomes}

Like any merger, those between WDs liberate tremendous amounts of energy.  This can lead to enough heating and/or compression to reignite the nuclear furnaces of normally inert WDs under either non-degenerate or degenerate circumstances.  As such, the end product of such mergers are diverse, ranging from stars with unusual properties undergoing stable nuclear burning to explosions. Hydrostatic (and non-rotating, unmagnetized {\charles CITATION}) WDs have a maximum stable mass beyond which bodies supported by electron degeneracy pressure are unstable to collapse.  This is known as the \cite{chan31} mass, or \Mch, and is at $\sim1.4\,\Msun$.  This has long led to the notion that sufficiently massive WD mergers can lead to the complete destruction of the merger product, either in a thermonuclear explosion that would resemble type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia; \citealt{webb84}), or transformation into a neutron star (NS) in an event known as an accretion-induced collapse \citep{nomoi85, saion85}.  Today, however, we know of a much greater range of possible merger outcomes, both for binary systems with masses above and below \Mch.  Which outcome occurs depends largely on the compositions of the WDs involved, and are briefly summarized below (see also \citealt{dan+14}, who produce a similar list):

% dan+14 Fig 12, dan+12 fig 8

\begin{itemize}
	\item The merger of {\bf two He WDs} is unlikely to lead to violent nuclear burning and an explosion \citep{dan+12,dan+14,dan+15}.  Instead, merger remnants with total masses $0.4\lesssim \Mtot \lesssim 0.8$ \citep{han+02,pacz71}\footnote{This is lower than the He flash mass of $\sim0.45\,\Msun$ because the merger remnant is partly non-degenerate \citep{han+02}.}, which are the vast majority of double He WD remnants \citep{nele10}, are expected to ignite He burning in a shell \citep{saioj00,zhanj12}.  This increases the radius and luminosity of the star until it becomes a yellow giant after $\sim 10^3-10^4\,\mrm{yr}$, with properties similar to extreme helium (EHe) and R Coronae Borealis (RCrB) stars {\charles \citep{saioj00, zhanj12}.}  Over the next $10^5-10^6\mrm{yr}$, the burning shell migrates inward with a series of weakening shell flashes, while the radius slowly shrinks to $\sim10^{-1}\,\Rsun$.  Once the shell reaches the center of the remnant, stable He fusion is ignited, and remnant settles onto the helium main sequence, resembling a subdwarf B or O star \citep{saioj00, justph11, zhanj12}.  While most subdwarf stars are in binaries, and likely form from other formation channels channels, mergers are expected to be a major -- perhaps even the main -- source of single subdwarf stars (eg. \citealt{han+03, nele10}).

	\item The outcome of a merger betwee {\bf an He and a CO WD}, or a merger between an He and hybrid He-CO WD, depends on whether or not a He explosion is touched off during the merger.  The conditions for which either occur remains a field of active research (eg. \citealt{holc+13, shenm14, dan+15}).  Roughly speaking, mergers with $\Mtot \lesssim 0.8\,\Msun$ are unlikely to trigger an explosion and will instead ignite He burning in a shell; they have been proposed as the progenitors to He-rich sdO stars (\citealt{justph11}; He-poor sdO stars are likely evolved sdB stars).  Mergers with $\Mtot \gtrsim 0.8\,\Msun$ that do not experience an explosion will also ignite shell burning, but unlike sdOB progenitors they will retain their extended envelope for the duration of their burning phase \citep{pacz71}.  These mergers are believed to be the primary formation channel for Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) and R CrB stars \citep{webb84, ibent84, saioj02, clay12, kararh15}, which are H-deficient, He- and C-rich supergiants that, in the case of R CrB stars, feature abrupt variability by up to a factor of $\sim10^3$ due to the formation of carbon dust above their photospheres.  Following He shell exhaustion, they will contract in radius and heat up their envelopes, becoming consistent with Extreme Helium (EHe) stars \cite{saioj02, jeff14}.

Helium explosions become more likely for binaries with $\Mtot\gtrsim\Mch$ \citep{woosk11, dan+14, dan+15}.  In cases where the He shell explodes, but the underlying CO WD remains, the result depends on a number of factors including the mass of the CO WD and amount of He it accretes, and spans a wide range of possible peak luminosities \citep{woosk11}.  Detonations (or deflagrations; \citealt{wooswk11}) of $\lesssim0.1\,\Msun$ He shells lead to explosions that reach peak brightnesses of factors of $\sim10-100$ lower than SNe Ia, in $\sim2-10$ days (typical SNe Ia values are in Sec. \ref{sec:c1_mysteryofsneia}), making them similar to the ``.Ia SNe'' theorized to occur in AM Canum Venaticorum binaries \citep{bild+07}.  They synthesize Ca, Cr and Ti, but relatively little of the radioactive \Ni\ typically seen in SNe Ia \citep{shen+10heshell, woosk11, wald+11}.  Denser He envelopes (due to it or the CO WD accretor being more massive), tend to synthesize more \Ni\ in detonations \citep{shen+10heshell, wald+11}. 

\cite{wald+11} also suggest that the detonation of $\sim0.2\,\Msun$ of He on top of a $\sim0.45\,\Msun$ CO WD could explain the SN 2005E-like class \citep{pere+10} of low-luminosity SNe Ib that produce very little \Ni, have low ejecta masses and spectroscopically show strong lines of He, Ca and Ti.  While these masses are remarkably low, \cite{shen+10heshell} and \cite{wald+11} model thick hydrostatic He envelopes around CO cores, and these will be much denser than He envelopes in merger remnants; moreover simulations suggest He detonations in mergers occur before a massive He envelope can accrete onto the disk (Sec. \ref{ssec:c1_new_typeia}).

%Less degenerate material will lead to explosions dominated by lighter elements like Ca \citep{woosk11}, and therefore He detonation may be possible in really massive systems.  Dan+14 already had that idea though; see below.

In the case where the the He shell detonates, and triggers the CO WD to do the same -- a ``double-detonation'' -- an SN Ia may be produced (Sec. \ref{ssec:c1_new_typeia}).

	\item The merger of {\bf two CO WDs} has long been suspected of producing an SN Ia under the right conditions (Sec. \ref{sec:mysteryofsneia} and \ref{sec:c1_vkchannel}).  If these conditions are not met, they will instead create a lone massive, rotating and highly magnetized CO WDs or, if steady carbon fusion is ignited, a carbon-burning star that eventually turns into an ONe WD (Sec. \ref{sec:c1_hotdqs}).  If the ONe WD is above \Mch, it may experience an AIC (see below).

	\item Mergers where the accretor is an {\bf ONe WD} will likely end in an accretion-induced collapse, or AIC.

\cite{dan+14} discusses the possibility that He - ONe and CO - ONe WD mergers will lead to enshrouded AIC that produce ``hybrid supernovae'', where much of the outer envelope (of a different composition) explodes rather than collapsing.  They suggest in particular that a significantly super-\Mch\ He - ONe merger could lead to a He detonation resembling the SN 2005E-like SNe Ib discussed earlier.

\end{itemize}

Of these possibilities, those mergers that can create SNe Ia are particularly intriguing


%\section{Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium White Dwarf Mergers}
%\label{sec:onemg}

%Due to their mass, it is likely that the merger of an ONeMg WD with any companion will create a super-Chandrasekhar mass remnant.  The consensus for such mergers is they are more likely to lead to accretion-induced collapse (AIC) than an explosion, though the matter is still not completely resolved \citep{yoonpr07,frye+10,dess+06}.  \cite{taub+11} note an ONeMg triggered to detonate by an ``external event'' may explode instead of collapsing, and mention it as a possible explantion for the very bright ($\sim 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$), slow-decaying SN 2009dc, which apparently ejected over 1.8 {\Msun} of {\Ni} at relatively low kinetic energies.  It is also worthwhile to note that according to Fig. \ref{wdbinarymasses} it is plausible to have an He-ONeMg WD binary whose total mass is below the Chandrasekhar mass, but such a system would interact via stable mass accretion, according to Sec. \ref{ssec:stabilityofmasstransfer}.  From the simulations of \citeauthor{loreig09}, a 0.6 CO - 1.2 ONeMg WD merger will result in carbon nuclear processing, but any runaway nuclear reactions appear to be quenched.  We did not find any simulations of runaway CO burning on an ONeMg WD.

%The optical transient of the AIC itself was simulated by \cite{dess+06}.  Their work showed that core collapse results in a shockwave that breaks out along the poles of the (rapidly spinning) WD, followed by a neutrino-driven wind concentrated along the poles that ultimately ejects $3 - 4 \times 10^{-3}$ {\Msun}, depending on the mass of the initial WD, at speeds in the range of 1 - 3 $\times 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$.  About a quarter of the ejected matter is {\Ni}.  The total energy of the explosion is on order $5 \times 10^{49}$ - $10^{50}$ erg.  The time before gamma rays can escape the ejecta is short, and in all this is not a strong optical transient compared to SNe \citep{metz+09}.  Note that earlier work by \cite{frye+99} predicted an order of magnitude higher total mass, energy and $^{56}$Ni.

%\cite{metz+09} propose a transient from a different source: following the AIC, the proto-neutron star will be surrounded by a $\sim 0.1$ - $0.5$ {\Msun} Keplerian disk with an outer radius of $\sim30$ - $100$ km and a temperature in the MeV range.  The disk will, due to MHD turbulence, hyper-accrete onto the NS at rates of up to $\sim$ 1 {\Msun} s$^{-1}$; by conservation of momentum, part of the disk will be ejected.  This disk will be proton-rich when it cools to below 1 MeV, and is efficiently synthesized into $^{56}$Ni.  \citeauthor{metz+09} calculate $3 \times 10^{-2}$ {\Msun} of ejecta, about a third of which is $^{56}$Ni, forming by this process from a $\sim 0.1$ {\Msun} accretion disk.  This outflow has similar energies and speeds ($\sim$ 10$^{50}$ erg, $\sim$ 30,000 km s$^{-1}$) to the AIC ejecta \citep{metz+09}.  The light curve from this transient, which they call a ``naked AIC transient'' is shown in Fig. \ref{AICtrans}.

%\citeauthor{metz+09} note that for a double-degenerate merger leading to an AIC, significant amounts ($\sim 0.1$ {\Msun}) of WD material will remain in a thick torus at a radius of $10^4$ km.  When the AIC ejecta and accretion disk outflow strike this outer envelope, ejecta speeds will slow from $3 \times 10^4 km s^{-1}$ to $3$ - $10 \times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$ while shock-heating the outer envelope up to $10^9$ K, which synthesizes intermediate mass elements.  The larger total ejecta mass and slower ejecta velocities increase the rise time of the transient from 1 day (the naked case) to $\sim 10$ days, as seen in Fig. \ref{AICtrans} \citep{metz+09}.  In addition to iron-peak elements, the AIC outflow should contain Cr, Kr, Se and Br (not commonly found in SNe), and interactions with the torus should add more intermediate elements which may, in total, constitute a spectrum unique to AICs \citep{metz+09}.  The exact composition of the ejecta will depend on the composition of the WD that merged with the ONeMg WD, and therefore composition could distinguish the difference between an He, CO and ONeMg-ONeMg merger.

%\cite{frye+09} simulated an enshrouded AIC at the centre of a merger remnant using a radiation-hydrodynamics code and values similar to \citeauthor{dess+06} ($2 \times 10^{50}$ erg total energy, $0.02$ {\Msun} ejecta, $4 \times 10^{-3}$ {\Msun} {\Ni}), and obtain a similar light curve to \citeauthor{metz+09}'s schematic light curve (Fig. \ref{AICtrans}).  A peak V-band magnitude of -16 was achieved in $\sim$ 10 days.  \cite{frye+09} also simulate an explosion with ten times the energy, mass and {\Ni} in accordance with \cite{frye+99}, and obtain a peak V-band magnitude of -18.5, achieved also in $\sim$ 10 days.  In neither explosion do they recover line features that would be unique to AICs in the resulting spectrum.  They also note that the high energies and low ejecta masses mean most of the ejecta is ionized and line emission is washed out - this occurs early on for their more powerful explosion, and after peak light for their weaker explosion.

%MARTEN: It's not clear from literature why the spectral features of Cr, Kr, Se and Br speculated by \citeauthor{metz+09} are not recovered in \cite{frye+09}'s spectra.  It's not really stated by \cite{frye+09}, though they most certainly know \citeauthor{metz+09}'s work.

The naked transient (total mass $2 \times 10^{-2}$ {\Msun}, $10^{-2}$ {\Msun} $^{56}$Ni, $v = 3 \times 10^4 km s^{-1}$), resulting from a stable mass transfer AIC, does not have an envelope left over from a WD merger, and rises and falls within a day's time.  The enshrouded AIC transient (total mass $2 \times 10^{-1}$ {\Msun}, $10^{-2}$ {\Msun} $^{56}$Ni, $v = 10^4 km s^{-1}$) results from a WD merger, and therefore as an envelope that stretches out the light curve over a week while keeping peak luminosity constant.

%SHOULD I USE FRYER'S INSTEAD - MORE BANDS??

%Such an ``enshrouded AIC'' transient could be responsible for SN 2008ha, whose rise time, peak luminosity, ejecta velocity, ejected mass and ejected {\Ni} are all within range of the corresponding values stated above.  With 0.16 {\Msun} ejected at speeds of $\sim 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim 0.02$ {\Msun} {\Ni} produced, and possible detection of Al II lines in its spectrum, SN 2010X is also an enshrouded AIC candidate \citep{kasl+10}.  It is not likely for this merger channel to explain all possible sub-luminous SNe Ia, as most others eject much more $^{56}$Ni than can be formed from an AIC-related transient \citep{fole+09}.

%If the WD merger remnant rotates differentially, then any initial poloidal magnetic field will be greatly amplified through the magnetorotational instability.  \cite{dess+07} show that the entire star consequently spins down by as much as 30\%, and the rotational energy lost is fed into a magnetically driven wind substantially more powerful than the neutrino wind described above.  Explosion energies then reach up to $\sim 10^{51}$ erg and $\sim$ 0.1 {\Msun} is ejected, though negligble amounts of {\Ni} are created.  The transient, therefore, is still fairly weak optically, and could instead be detected via neutrino and gravitational wave emission \citep{dess+07}.

%\citeauthor{metz+09} also speculate as to whether an AIC could emit a collimated relativistic outflow, thereby creating a short gamma-ray burst.  One advantage to AIC-GRBs is that the late-time (around 10 - 100 s) x-ray tail seen in some short GRBs could plausibly be explained by late-time accretion of merger remnant material not carried away by the initial AIC outflow, or by magnetar outflows (assuming one is created by an AIC).  See \cite{dess+07}, however, for discussion as to why AICs likely will not create short GRBs unless the collapsing WD eventually forms a black hole.  This 10 - 100 s x-ray emission might be seen regardless, and could be a target for x-ray survey missions \citep{metz+09}.

%%WHY IS TOTAL ENERGY GREATER IN ENSHROUDED CASE?

%%-Nucleosythetically speaking, could an ONeMg WD create an SN Ia?  I.e. the ejecta composition should be different, but in what way?  Fairly sure the answer's no - see Taubenberger on ONeMg explosion speculation.



%For a helium WD merging with a carbon-oxygen one, a helium giant could form, observable as a hydrogen-deficient giant or RCrB star.  

%For two carbon-oxygen WDs (CO WDs), the outcome could vary between simply a more massive WD, a carbon-burning star, an explosion, or collapse to a neutron star, depending on whether stable or unstable carbon fusion is ignited, and whether the total mass exceeds the critical mass for pycnonuclear ignition or electron captures (both close to the Chandrasekhar mass \Mch).  For mergers involving an oxygen-neon WD, the mass will always be high, and explosive demise or transmutation seems inevitable.


%%The merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) originally in a short-period binary is estimated (eg. \citealt{badem12}) to occur about once every century in a Milky Way-like galaxy, making the products of such events common throughout the universe.  They have been held responsible for producing a variety of stars with strange properties, including helium-burning sdOB stars \citep{saioj00, justph11}, RCrB stars (eg. \citealt{webb84, clay+07, clay13}), and massive and highly magnetized WDs (eg. \citealt{segrcm97, garc+12, kule+13}) that could resemble the hot DQ WDs (eg. \citealt{dunlc15}, Dunlap and Clements in preparation).  They may, however, also be responsible for spectacular transient events including accretion-induced collapses (eg. \citealt{saion85, abdi+10}) and type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia; eg. \citealt{howe11, hill+13, maozmn14}).  Determining the final outcome of a particular merger requires an understanding of the detailed dynamics of the merging process, which cannot directly be seen using current observational capabilities.  Thus, studies of merger physics have primarily utilized hydrodynamic simulations.
