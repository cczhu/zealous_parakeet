\section{Conclusions and Ramifications for Mergers}
\label{sec:c3_conclusion}

We simulate the merger of a $0.625-0.65\,\Msun$ CO WD merger in the SPH code \gasoline\ and moving mesh code \arepo, to determine if the outcome of these simulations depend on the code being used.  We find differences between the simulations to be small for all phases of the merger up to coalescence.  Immediately following coalescence, there is a greater temperature contrast between the void and dense remnant core material in \arepo\ than in \gasoline, but otherwise the remnants look remarkably similar to one another.  Over the next several hundred seconds, however, the \gasoline\ remnant spins down to axisymmetry, and the remnant's temperature becomes roughly uniform.  The \arepo\ remnant, on the other hand, maintains the integrity of a dense, crescent-shaped cold core surrounded by a hot, tenuous void, over $\sim1000\,\mrm{s}$.  The core generates a lopsided gravitational potential, which launches an $m = 1$ spiral mode into the disk.  This mode transports angular momentum an order of magnitude faster than an equivalent $\alpha$-viscosity disk with $\alpha = 10^{-2}$.  We suggest that this non-axisymmetric perturbation may related to the low $T/|W|$ instability seen in neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova remnants, and possibly the ARS instability found in the disks of massive WD merger remnants, and that the perturbation is not captured in \gasoline\ potentially because of SPH surface tension and artificial viscosity effects.  The latter contextualizes the need to perform merger simulations in SPH codes updated wtih improved handling mixing and contact discontinuity in the future.  Exploration of this post-merger instability and the conditions under which it arises is also left for future work.

Our results suggest that prior simulations performed in SPH (eg. \citeal{loreig09}, \citeal{zhu+13}), would not be significantly revised if performed instead in \arepo.  Comparing the tests in Sec. \ref{sec:c2_variation} to our results, we note that elements not considered in our work, such as nuclear reactions and proper modelling of the tidal bulges (eg. \citealt{dan+11}), may lead to as large or larger differences in the merging process and structure of the remnant.  

Our results are of greater consequence for post-merger evolution, which until now has been believed to occur on a viscous timescale (\citeal{vkercj10}, \citealt{shen+12}), and has been simulated using Eulerian codes on an 2.5D  axisymmetric cylindrical grid \citep{schw+12,ji+13}.  These are, of course, unable to directly capture non-axisymmetric features of the remnant, and we therefore stress the need to extend post-merger evolution simulations to three dimensions.  A simulation that extends to $10^4\,\mrm{s}$ could realistically be performed on \arepo.  We are currently investigating the source of the spurious cold ring it seen at late times, to ensure \arepo\ does not generate systematic errors over this timespan.  For, we note that our results likely do not qualitatively change previous conclusions about the outcome of post-merger evolution \citep{schw+12,ji+13}, as the disk angular momentum transport by hydrodynamic waves will also lead to a general loss of remnant angular momentum and the transformation of the disk into a hot envelope.

We have also yet to extend our work to mergers of CO WDs with other masses.  Current results suggest that they will likely resemble current SPH-based results until coalescence, but it remains to be seen if non-axisymmetric perturbations during post-merger evolution depend on the total mass or mass ratio of the merging binary.  A parameter-space study could also pinpoint the range of remnants that experience a detonation due to rapid accretion via spiral modes, as seen in \cite{kash+15}.

Finally, our simulation does not contain magnetic fields, which, as will be discussed in Ch. \ref{ch:ch4}, are likely to be significantly amplified during the merger and early phases of post-merger evolution.  This could substantially affect the remnant's non-axisymmetric features: for differentially-rotating magnetized NSs that feature the low $T/|W|$ instability, \cite{muhl+14} find fields had either a suppressive and an \textit{amplifying} effect on the instability, depending on their strength.  In our own magnetized merger simulations, the remnant becomes axisymmetric within $\sim300\,\mrm{s}$ after coalescence, but we use the Powell scheme for divergence cleaning (Sec. \ref{sec:c4_postscript}) and likely resolve the remnant disk too poorly to capture the fastest growing magnetorotational instability mode \citep{ji+13}.  Future investigation of post-merger MHD evolution is, therefore, also warranted.

%The more impactful change to the conclusion of other works we make is that hydrodynamic evolution does not stop at coalescence, and a spiral wave-mediated spin down of the merger remnant occurs over several thousand seconds.  This spin-down originates from the non-axisymmetry of the remnant core, which itself originates from material from the tidally destroyed donor impacting the accretor.  Merger remnants of dissimilar-mass mergers will experience far less accretor disruption than the system we present here, but we find for a low-resolution 0.5 - 1.0 \Msun\ CO WD merger that the \textit{donor} does not disrupt into a completely axisymmetric disk around the accretor, and this non-axisymmetry powers a spiral wave propagating into the disk.  Hydrodynamic spin down is therefore likely prevalent throughout the majority of the WD merger parameter space.

%Because previous works found hydrodynamic evolution to stop at coalescence, it was expected that the next phase of evolution for the remnant would be a magnetically-driven spin-down phase lasting of order hours to days \citep{vkercj10, shen+12}.  \cite{schw+12} and \cite{ji+13} have both simulated this evolution by porting SPH merger results into 2.5D hydrodynamic simulations.  \citeauthor{schw+12} use \textsc{zeus-mp2} fitted with the Helmholtz EoS, a \cite{shaks73} shear viscosity set to $\alpha = 3 \times 10^{-2}$ and a five-isotope nuclear network in order to evolve merger remnants imported from \cite{dan+11} with a span of masses and compositions.  For their fiducial 0.6 - 0.9 \Msun\ remnant, they find it nearly completely spins down over $3\times10^4$ s, transferring its disk mass and most of its angular momentum into a thermally supported thin envelope (the remnant core barely changes in mass).  The material at interface between core and disk, where there is a temperature peak, is compressed by loss of rotational support such that its temperature increases from $5\times10^8$ K to $7.5\times10^8$ K, and its density from $2\times10^5$ \gcc\ to $6\times10^5$ \gcc.  Very little mass is lost.  \citeauthor{ji+13} use \flash\ in AMR mode to simululate the full magnetohydrodynamic evolution of a 0.6 - 0.6 \Msun remnant ported from \citeauthor{loreig09} and augmented with a weak poloidal seed magnetic field.  Over $2\times10^4$ s, the remnant core loses 70\% of its angular momentum, the magnetic field strengthens from $3\times10^5$ G to $2\times10^8$ G, most of the disk mass is accreted onto the remnant (with 0.06 \Msun\ forming a thin envelope at large distance).  The core's central density and temperature rise from $\sim2\times10^6$ \gcc and $\sim4\times10^8$ K to $\sim5\times10^6$ \gcc and $\sim9\times10^8$ K, leading to a core nuclear runaway.

%In addition to being more than an order-of-magnitude faster, our hydrodynamic spin-down phase results in a somewhat different remnant.  All three simulations agree that disk material will spread outward from the disk plane, and that much of the disk will turn into a thermally-supported hot envelope.  The core-envelope interface, which is the location of the off-centre temperature peak, increases in density and temperature from , and the center of the remnant also compresses by a factor of 3.  On the other hand, while \citeauthor{ji+13} find their ``white dwarf merger'' (roughly equivalent to our merger core and dense portion of the thermal envelope \gcc ) accretes 0.16 {\Msun}, and \citeauthor{schw+12} find theirs remains at approximately 1 {\Msun} (their Fig. 4), our \arepo\ ``WD merger'' actually loses mass, from 1.1 \Msun to 0.95 \Msun\ (and of this, only 0.65 \Msun\ is degeneracy energy dominated; see Fig. \ref{fig:comp}).  We also find no unbound outflow of mass, even though our mass resolution, $10^{-6}$ \Msun\, is three orders of magnitude below the mass loss reported by \citeauthor{ji+13} and one below that reported by \citeauthor{schw+12}.  That \cite{ji+13} find a central nuclear runaway, and we do not, is primarily due to their use of \cite{loreig09}'s 0.6 - 0.6 {\Msun} remnant, than differences in post-coalescence evolution.  At \citeauthor{loreig09}'s remnant has its highest temperature at the center of the core, and is overall much hotter than our \arepo\ (and even our \gasoline) remnant just after coalescence.

%With most of the rotational energy in the entire system converted to thermal energy, viscous evolution will be unimportant to the spun-down remnant.  As discussed in \cite{shen+12}, thermal evolution will now dominate the system.  Throughout much of the envelope, radiation pressure is comparable or exceeds gas pressure, and so the remnant's luminosity will be of order the Eddington luminosity \citep{shen+12}, and may also launch a wind.  Our spun-down remnant contains a shell of $\sim10^6$ \gcc\ material at $\sim8\times10^7$ K, which is sufficient to generate a convective carbon burning shell.  The end state of this evolution is likely an oxygen-neon WD \citep{nomoi85, shen+12}.  Since the total system mass is far below the Chandrasekhar mass, the densities required for accretion-induced collapse will not be reached.  While we substitute a viscous angular momentum transport phase for a hydrodynamic one, we do not predict, based on the results in this paper, the final outcome of a merger to be all that different from previous expectations.
