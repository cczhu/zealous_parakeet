\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:c3_intro}

%According to Loren-Aguilar et al. 2009, the very, very first WD simulations were made by Mochkovitch and Livio 1989 (1989A%26A...209..111M) using the self-consistent field method (SCF).  SCF isn't, as far as I can tell, time-dependent, so really they were just calculating the self-consistent structure of the merger remnant.  They do cite earlier RLOF work by Gingold and Monaghan 1979, but those simulations aren't of WD mergers per se.

Simulations of white dwarf (WD) mergers are a window into the detailed dynamics of the merging process and -- since mergers cannot directly be seen using current observational capabilities -- a link between observations of strange stars and explosive transients and theories about their formation.  Since the pioneering work of \cite{benz+90}, these simulations have overwhelmingly used a single numerical hydrodynamics implementation, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH).  Within SPH, regions of high density are automatically more resolved and advection is simulated without errors; its equations of motion also inherently conserve energy, linear and angular momentum.  These features make it attractive for modeling the complex fluid flows present in mergers.  Building on \citeauthor{benz+90} and other early works such as \cite{segrcm97} and \cite{guerig04}, more recent efforts have focused on more precise binary initial conditions \citep{dan+11}, exploration of remnant properties across parameter space (Ch. \ref{ch:ch2}; \citealt{loreig09, rask+12, dan+14}) and exploring the possible instigation and consequences of a nuclear explosion caused by the merger (eg. \citealt{pakm+10, dan+12, pakm+13, moll+14, rask+14}).

The traditional SPH formulation, however, is not without its problems (eg. \citealt{spri10,hopk15}): to be able to capture shocks, it uses an artificial viscosity, which can produce spurious heating and angular momentum transport in shear flows; it is known to suppress hydrodynamic instabilities; and it captures shocks and steep gradients relatively poorly compared to other schemes at the same resolution.  Shocks, large-scale shear flows and the formation of instabilities are all expected for WD mergers, and comparisons between SPH and Eulerian grid codes for other astrophysical phenomena (eg. \citealt{dval+06, tracsp07, mitc+09}) have often shown qualitative and resolution-independent differences.  Reproducing simulations across different types of codes is essential both for the development of numerical hydrodynamic schemes and for ensuring the physical validity of their results, and so we are motivated to simulate mergers with other hydrodynamic schemes.

%This suggests the need to simulate WD mergers with other hydrodynamics schemes.

A recent alternative to SPH, as well as Eulerian grid codes, is \arepo\ \citep{spri10}, one of a growing class of codes (eg. \citealt{duffm11, gabujl12, vandr16}) that render fluid evolution on a dynamically moving, unstructured mesh.  \arepo\ retains the accurate treatment of shocks and instabilities as well as low velocity noise and negligible artificial viscosity in smooth flows that Eulerian grid codes feature, while gaining the automatic refinement and Galilean invariance inherent to SPH.  These features, coupled with a tree-based self-gravity solver, make it particularly attractive for astrophysical simulations (eg. \citealt{voge+12, pakms13, hayw+14, marips14, ohlm+16}), and, with the notable exception of formal angular momentum conservation, ideal for simulating WD mergers.  \cite{pakm+13} has already used \arepo\ to investigate initial mass transfer, and the possibility that transfer sets off a helium detonation, in a 0.9 - 1.1 \Msun\ CO WD merger.

In this work, we compare the merger of a $0.625 - 0.65\,\Msun$ carbon-oxygen (CO) WD binary simulated in \arepo\ with one simulated in the SPH code \gasoline\ \citep{wadssq04}.  We generate identical initial conditions for both simulations, and disable chemical and nuclear evolution to focus solely on the hydrodynamic differences, aiming to learn whether critical hydrodynamic phenomena might have been missing or misrepresented in past SPH-based merger simulations.  Our results show that the two simulations closely resemble one another until the two WDs coalesce, after which the \gasoline\ merger remnant becomes axisymmetric over several hundred seconds, while the \arepo\ one remains asymmetric for much longer, potentially altering post-merger evolution.

%This work is also a companion to \citeauthor{zhu+15} (\citeyear{zhu+15}; henceforth \citeal{zhu+15}), which presents the growth of a seed magnetic field within the \arepo-based merger to amplitudes of $\sim10^{10}-10^{11}\,\mrm{G}$, which also has significant consequences for post-merger evolution.

In Section~\ref{sec:c3_codes}, we review the hydrodynamic schemes of SPH and \arepo, and discuss the parameters and initial conditions used in each simulation.  In Section~\ref{sec:c3_fixingarepo}, we summarize efforts to improve angular momentum conservation within \arepo.  In Section~\ref{sec:c3_results}, we present results for each code and compare their outcomes.  Lastly, in Sections~\ref{sec:c3_discussion} and \ref{sec:c3_conclusion}, we discuss which code represents the more physical result, and implications for mergers.
