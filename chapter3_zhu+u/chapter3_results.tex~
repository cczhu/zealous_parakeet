Fig. \ref{fig:c3_diagslice} compares snapshots at various times in the \gasoline\ and \arepo\ simulations.

The initial evolution of the two systems, shown in row 1 of Fig. \ref{fig:c3_diagslice}, is qualitatively similar.  Our initial conditions are approximate, so both stars immediately tidally stretch in response to the binary potential, overshooting their Roche lobes in the process and transferring mass to each other in spurts.  This eventually dies down for the $0.65\,\Msun$ accretor, and becomes steady mass transfer for the $0.625\,\Msun$ donor, just prior to it becoming fully disrupted.  In reality, the $0.625\,\Msun$ donor WD should overflow first and begin a period of quasi-stable mass transfer over potentially dozens of orbits, and so our simulations, both of which experience donor full disruption in just a few orbits, overestimate the rate of early mass transfer \citep{dan+11}.

% To check the mach number, I compared the velocity of the stream (in the frame of the accretor's center 2.5x10^8 cm/s) with the sound-speed of the outer layers of the accretor (1.3x10^8 cm/s).  Hot atmosphere temperatures from paper_propsatdisruption(frame="early")

The accretion streams in both codes are travelling at supersonic speeds ($\mathcal{M} \approx 2$) relative to the accretor when they impact, and as a result the streams shock-heat at impact and their material rapidly thermalize.  By the time the donor is fully disrupted a hot atmosphere has formed around the accretor.  This atmosphere has a temperature of $1.6 \times 10^8\,\mrm{K}$ in  \arepo\ and $1.9\times 10^8\,\mrm{K}$ in \gasoline\ -- both about half of the virial temperature, $GM_am_P/3R_ak_B \approx 4 \times 10^8\,\mrm{K}$ -- with corresponding densities of $1.8\times10^5\,\gcc$ and $2.3\times10^5\,\gcc$, respectively.  As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:c3_diagslice} row 1, \arepo's hot atmosphere is somewhat less extended and tends to have more localized hotspots in temperature compared to the extended and uniform one in \gasoline.  This may be due to a combination of \arepo\ not oversmoothing the gradients within the atmosphere, and having superior spatial resolution for the same mass resolution compared to \gasoline.

% Note to self: M = 10 is cited by Guillochon et al. 2010 by comparing the Keplerian velocity to the local soundspeed.  I'm using the actual velocity compared to the soundspeed, which is apparently much lower.  At best, we can get M = 3.  

% I'm taking the temperature of the hot atmosphere 20 s before disruption and using the hottest 1% of all particles in the system.  I'd report similar values just through visual inspection of the "Equatorial hot atmosphere temperature comparison" plot in papercalc.py

As mass transfer continues to expand the donor and draw it closer to the accretor, eventually tidal forces between the two WDs are strong enough to fully disrupt the donor, stretching it out into a thick stream of material that wraps around the accretor, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:c3_diagslice} row 1.  In both simulations, this occurs $\sim3.7$ orbital periods of the initial binary, or $\sim180\,\mrm{s}$, after the start of simulation, by which time the donor has transferred $\sim0.05\,\Msun$ to the accretor.  During coalescence, both the density and temperature profiles appear very similar between the codes, and the destruction of the donor takes over the same amount of time -- about one orbital period ($49.5\,\mrm{s}$) -- in both codes.

%Just read the KH blob temperatures off from the intensity plots at the disruption time of t = 180 s.  Lengths and widths were manually measured from the intensity plots with a temperature range of [1e7 to 3e8] and averaged between the three blobs for each simulation.  Peak temperatures visually read out of each blob and averaged for reported values.

Once the donor is fully disrupted, and coalescence begins, a portion of it forms an accretion stream that slides across the accretor at supersonic speeds, creating a string of Kelvin-Helmholtz vorticies.  In \arepo\ these vorticies are markedly more pronounced, being both larger by $\sim30$\% in radius, and having a slightly higher temperature of $\sim5\times10^8$ K compared to \gasoline's $\sim4\times10^8$ K.  The stream continues to inspiral toward the center of the accretor, severely deforming the accretor while carrying the string of Kelvin-Helmholtz vorticies toward the center of the system.  The two WDs have nearly equal masses, so material near the surface of the accretor is dredged up and mixes with the stream, and the shape of the accretor is severely disrupted from a sphere into a crescent shape.  Meanwhile, the remainder of the donor material increases its average distance from the accretor (conserving total angular momentum), wrapping around it as a thick sub-Keplerian disk.  Coalescence is approximately complete when the average separation between material from the donor and accretor changes from its initial value of $2.2\times10^9\,\mrm{cm}$ to its equilibrium value of $\sim1-2\times10^8\,\mrm{cm}$.  We thus estimate the time when coalescence is complete, \tcoal, by determining the time when average donor-accretor separation reaches a tenth of its initial value.  We find $\tcoal = 228\,\mrm{s}$ for \gasoline, and $220\,\mrm{s}$ for \arepo\ (roughly Fig. \ref{fig:c3_diagslice}, row 3).

The profiles are, from top to bottom, density $\rho$, angular rotation speed $\Omega$, temperature $T$, specific degeneracy energy  $e_{\rm deg}$, specific thermal energy $e_{\rm th}$, and specific rotational energy $e_{\rm rot}$, all as a function of the ratio of spherical enclosed to total mass $M/M_{\rm tot}$.

In Fig. \ref{fig:c3_curves}, we plot profiles of density, temperature and energy for the merger remnants $99\,\mrm{s}$ ($2$ orbital periods) after coalescence, roughly equivalent to row 4 of Fig. \ref{fig:c3_diagslice}.  Profiles both along the orbital plane of the original binary, or ``equatorial plane'' (solid lines) and rotational axis (dotted) are considered, and like \citeal{zhu+13} we map (equatorial) $\varpi$ and (rotational) $z$ positions to the corresponding ratio of spherical enclosed mass to total mass $M/M_{\rm tot}$.  The equatorial profiles are axisymmetrically averaged, while the rotational axis ones are averaged from the profiles above and below the equatorial plane.  As a whole, the two remnants have very similar structures: both feature a degeneracy-supported core surrounded by a rotationally supported thick disk along the equatorial plane and by a hot, thermally supported atmosphere along the axis of rotation.  Following \citeal{zhu+13} Sec. {\charles 3.2.3}, we find the disk mass $\Mdisk = 0.23\,\Msun$ and the core-envelope mass $\Mrem = 1.05\,\Msun$ in both simulations, though we note that the core-envelope also has substantial rotational support throughout.\footnote{The mass of material whose degeneracy specific energy is $>50$\% of their total specific energy is $\sim0.8\,\Msun$ in both simulations, as it is in \cite{zhu+15}.}  Both remnants' internal energies ($1.5\times10^{50}\,\mrm{erg}$) are also identically divided into $\sim30$\% rotational, $\sim10$\% thermal and $\sim60$\% degeneracy energy.  One minor difference between the two codes is the total amount of material unbound by the merger -- $1.4\times10^{-3}$ \Msun\ in \gasoline, and $5.0\times10^{-3}$ \Msun\ in \arepo -- though this value is much smaller and harder to constrain than the bulk values above.

The simulations' profiles in Fig. \ref{fig:c3_curves} are likewise very similar in shape to one another: both, for example, have a peak density of $\sim3\times10^6\,\gcc$ and a large fraction of their mass rotating nearly rigidly at $\sim0.3\,\psec$.  We also plot the \arepo\ MHD simulation from \cite{zhu+15} in grey, and find it is similar to both simulations, indicating that including magnetic dynamo effects lead only to minor changes in the \textit{hydrodynamics} in the merger.  The greatest discrepancy is in the factor of $\sim2$ decrease in the temperature curve at small $M/M_{\rm tot}$ in the \arepo\ simulation.

That discrepancy, however, reflects a growing evolutionary difference visible in rows 4 - 6 of Fig. \ref{fig:c3_diagslice}.  Just after coalescence, the center of the merger remnant in both simulations is clearly divided betwee the dense and cold crescent-shaped region, formed from the perturbed core of the accreting WD, and a low-density void that is an order of magnitude hotter, formed by material roughly evenly mixed between donor and accretor (this void appears as a column in the $xz$ plots of Fig. \ref{fig:c3_diagslice}).  $99\,\mrm{s}$ after coalescense, the hot void has a density and temperature of $\sim2\times10^6\,\gcc$ and $\sim6\times10^8\,\mrm{K}$, respectively, in both codes, but the \arepo\ void is $\sim80$\% larger in radius.  The cold crescent, meanwhile, has a density of $\sim4\times10^6\,\gcc$ in both codes, but has a temperature of $\sim2\times10^8\,\mrm{K}$ \gasoline\ versus $\sim5\times10^7\,\mrm{K}$ in \arepo.  Over the next several hundred seconds, the \gasoline\ remnant's crescent deforms and becomes axisymmetric, eliminating the hot void in the process; material from the void moves off of the equatorial plane to form two $\sim3.5\times10^8\,\mrm{K}$ hotspots along the rotational axis (row 6 of Fig. \ref{fig:c3_diagslice}).  By $t\approx500\,\mrm{s}$, the \gasoline\ remnant structure -- an oblate spheroidal core with a roughly uniform temperature of $\sim 2 \times 10^8\,\mrm{K}$ (outside of the hotspots) and surrounded by a stubby disk -- has stopped changing on a hydrodynamic timescale (roughly equal to one binary orbital period).  \arepo, on the other hand, maintains the distinction between its crescent and void, and consequently remains non-axisymmetric, for more than a thousand seconds after coalescence.  The system's center of rotation and mass are at the midpoint along the boundary between the crescent and void, and the dense crescent revolves around this point (rather than spinning about it).  This generates a lopsided gravitational potential that perturbs the surrounding disk, launching an $m = 1$ one-armed spiral wave into the surrounding medium.  The pattern speed is $\Omega_p \approx 0.4\,\mrm{s}^{-1}$ (as is the angular speed of the crescent), and the base of the spiral wave is at $\varpi \approx 1.5\times10^9\,\mrm{cm}$, where $\Omega \approx 0.2\,\mrm{s}^{-1}$ -- in 2:1 resonance with the crescent.

\end{figure}

Since spiral waves can transport angular momentum, we show the evolution of $z$-axis angular momentum \Lz\ within concentric cylinders in Fig. \ref{fig:c3_angmo} for the two simulations.  We see that all cylinders slowly lose angular momentum after colaescence in the \gasoline\ simulation, likely a consequence of artificial viscosity.  In \arepo, $\Lz(\varpi < 3\times10^9\,\mrm{cm})$ decreases at a rate of $d\Lz/dt = 1.2\times10^{47}\,\mrm{g}\,\mrm{cm}^2\,\mrm{s}^{-2}$ (compared to $3.3\times10^{46}\,\mrm{g}\,\mrm{cm}^2\,\mrm{s}^{-2}$ in \gasoline), reflecting the wave's angular momentum transport.  Using Eqn. \ref{eq:c3_angmobalance} on the cylinder to estimate contributions to angular momentum change, we find around $\sim85$\% of this decrease can be accounted for by the advective term, suggesting the spiral wave transports angular momentum through Reynolds stresses (rather than gravitational torque; \citealt{kratl16}).  The \Lz\ within \innercyl\ decreases by $\sim5$\% by the end of the simulation at $t = 1000\,\mrm{s}$, but the loss of angular momentum in the disk also results in the enclosed mass within \innercyl\ increasing by $0.02\,\Msun$ over the same timeframe.  In fact, the remnant disk has transported over half of its angular momentum to much larger distances by this time; the corresponding timescale is comparable to that for an $\alpha$-viscosity disk with $\alpha \sim 10^{-1}$.  At $t = 1000\,\mrm{s}$, \arepo's void has shrunk by about a quarter of its initial radius, but the remnant core remains non-axisymmetric and the spiral wave persists, and so angular momentum transport will continue on a hydrodynamic timescale.

%Under both codes, the remnant core is a cresent-shaped object off of the centre of rotation, flanked on one side by a low-density hot void, and therefore features a prominent $m = 1$ non-axisymmetric mode that we expect to either gravitationally torque or hydrodynamically stir the surrounding medium.  Disturbances generated by the core will naturally be stretched out into a trailing spiral pattern due to the differential rotation of the sub-Keplerian disk.

%\arepo, on the other hand, maintains the integrity of the cresent and void for hundreds of seconds.  In the high-resolution simulation, by $t = 200$ s, a single spiral with a $\delta \rho/\left\langle\rho\right\rangle$ of $\sim1$ and Mach number $\mathcal{M} \approx 2$ is generated, either through ram pressure, tides, or by a combination of the two, near the transition between the remnant core and disk.  Once generated, they hydrodynamically transport angular momentum outward before disappearing past $10^{10}$ cm, accounting for the strong \Lzinner\ loss seen in Fig. \ref{fig:angmo}.  Some dissipation occurs before the shock reaches $10^{10}$ cm, though, as we also find an outward mass flux throughout the entire disk, and a gain in angular momentum for material past $\sim3\times10^9$ cm.  These shocks also do not propagate only along the mid-disk: they trace out expanding semicircular arcs in the $r_\mrm{xy}-z$ plane, spreading material beyond the plane of the disk in a fan shape.

%\arepo, on the other hand, maintains the coherency of its void over hundreds of seconds as the torus of dense material deforms into a crescent and hydrodynamically launches a single spiral wave into the surrounding medium.  Over time, this spiral wave transports angular momentum away from the core, allowing the crescent to sink toward the remnant center of mass.  This is radically different than what we see in \gasoline, and has not been reported by other SPH simulation works, which suggests that there is a phase of hydrodynamic evolution following coalescence that is not properly captured by traditional SPH.  Unfortunately, issues with angular momentum conservation in \arepo\ prevent us from reliably following this post-merger hydrodynamic evolution further than a few hundred seconds, and we cannot definitely say if the remnant core is able to lose much of its angular momentum via spiral waves.  This issue is further discussed in Sec. \ref{ssec:pmeloss}.

%We have attempted to extend this simulation by several thousand seconds to probe the long-term stability of the remnant's structure, but find instead the spontaneous development of a dense $<10^7\,\mrm{K}$ layer (much colder than any material surrounding it) at the boundary between the remnant core and disk.
