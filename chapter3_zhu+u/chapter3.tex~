The physics and final outcomes of the merger of two white dwarfs can currently only be directly studied in detail through 3D hydrodynamic simulations, and to date merger simulations have largely relied on smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, a method known to produce numerical artefacts under certain conditions.  In order to determine if the outcome of these simulations depend on the code being used, we followed the merger of a $0.625 - 0.65\,\Msun$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf binary in both the SPH code \gasoline\ and the moving mesh code \arepo.  We find that the two agree well with one another until the merger is complete.  Afterward, the merger remnant becomes axisymmetric over the course of a few hundred seconds in \gasoline, with most of its mass comprising a dense, oblate-spheroidal core.  The remnant in \arepo, on the other hand, remains non-axisymmetric and features a crescent-shaped core flanked on one side by a hot, underdense ``void''.  This configuration has an offset gravitational potential, which launches an $m = 1$ spiral mode within the surrounding disk that transports disk angular momentum over a timescale of $\sim10^3-10^4\,\mrm{s}$ comparable to that of the standard $\alpha$-viscosity formulation.  These code-dependent differences could substantially affect processes that occur early-on during post-merger viscous evolution, from magnetic dynamo processes to the possible onset of a nuclear detonation.  The final product, of the merging process, however, likely remains a spherically symmetric dense core surrounded by a hot, non-degenerate envelope, regardless of which code is used.

This chapter is heavily updated from an unpublished paper from late 2014.  I include a summary of our preliminary investigation in 2013-2014, which led to the discovery that \arepo\ failed to conserve angular momentum over timescales relevant to the merger.  The latter resulted in modifications to \arepo\ \cite{pakm+16}, which I also summarize.


%Since we performed our study, SPH codes, including \gasoline, have been updated to resolve many of their classic deficiencies, and a comparison with modern codes may yield different results.
