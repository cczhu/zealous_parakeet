This chapter is a revised version of an unpublished paper completed in late 2014.  In addition, I give a qualitative overview of SPH and moving mesh \arepo, and includes a summary of our preliminary investigation, which lead to the discovery that \arepo\ failed to conserve angular momentum over relevant timescales.  The latter eventually led to the publication of \cite{pakm+16}, which I also summarize.  Since we performed our study, SPH codes, including \gasoline, have been updated to resolve many of their classic deficiencies, and a comparison with modern codes may yield different results.
