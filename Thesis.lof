For similar-mass mergers, equatorial temperatures have been adjusted to account for mixing in convectively unstable cores. Right: maximum temperatures and corresponding densities following estimated post-merger evolution. The estimate assumes that the remnant spins down completely, that all rotational energy is used to drive matter to large distances, and that the remainder adjusts adiabatically (see text). Also shown are contours of constant neutrino cooling timescale $\tau _\mathrm {\nu }\equiv C_P T/\varepsilon _\nu $ and carbon fusion heating timescale $\tau _\mathrm {cc}\equiv C_P T/\varepsilon _{\rm CC}$, both in years, as well as entropy $S$ in ${\rm erg\,K^{-1}}$. (Here, $C_P$ is the heat capacity at constant pressure and $\epsilon $ the specific energy loss/gain rate.) The lines labeled $\tau _\mathrm {cc} = \tau _\mathrm {\nu }$ and $\tau _\mathrm {cc} = \tau _\mathrm {dyn}$ denote where the carbon fusion heating timescale balances the neutrino cooling and dynamical timescales, respectively.
