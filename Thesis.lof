In SPH (left), the fluid is discretized into particles, each of which possesses a position ${\bf r}_i$, mass $m_i$, velocity ${\bf u}_i$ and specific internal energy $e_i$. The density $\rho _i$ of a given particle (red point) is determined by kernel sampling its neighbors (blue) within a smoothing length $h_i$ (Eqn. \ref {eq:c3_kernelavg_rho}); pressure $P_i$ is then obtained using the density and internal energy. The particle is evolved by kernel sampling nearby pressures and densities, and applying the SPH equations of motion (Eqns. \ref {eqn:c3_spheqnm} and \ref {eqn:c3_spheqne}). In \textsc {Arepo}\ (right), the fluid is discretized using an unstructured mesh defined by Voronoi tessellation. Each Voronoi cell possesses a mesh-generating point ${\bf r}_i$ and a set of conserved quantities equivalent to ``primitive variables'' ${\bf W}_i = \left (\rho _i, {\bf u}_i, P_i, {\bf B}_i\right )$, i.e. the values of density, velocity, pressure and magnetic field amplitude at the cell's center of mass ${\bf s}_i$. Note that ${\bf r}_i \not ={\bf s}_i$, but their separation is typically a few percent of the cell's radius, and has been exaggerated above. Fluxes between two cells $\mathrm {L}$ and $\mathrm {R}$ are calculated by propagating their primitive variables ${\bf W}_\mathrm {L,R}$ to the centroid of their interface ${\bf f}$ to obtain ${\bf W}_\mathrm {L,R}^\mathrm {interface}$ (Eqn. \ref {eq:c3_muscl_hancock}, or Eqn. \ref {eq:c3_rk2_timeevo} following \citealt {pakm+16}), and then solving the Riemann problem (in the frame of the interface). The mesh is evolved by moving the mesh generating points ${\bf r}_i$ at roughly the fluid velocity ${\bf u}_i$, calculating fluxes between all cells, and then updating each cell's conserved quantities. While evolving an SPH particle requires the use of dozens of its neighbors for kernel averaging, evolving an \textsc {Arepo}\ cell only requires those neighbors directly adjacent to it.}}{77}{figure.3.1}

Red Xs are end of simmering points for \domm {\domm {\Delta }_\mathrm {conv}}-inclusive tracks.
