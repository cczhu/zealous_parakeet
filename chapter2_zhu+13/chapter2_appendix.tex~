\section{Postscript: Post-Merger Evolution Revised}
\label{sec:postscript_pme}

Since the publication of \citeal{zhu+13}, the work of \cite{ji+13} was published, which is relevant not only because they simulate the post-merger evolution of an equal-mass $0.6-0.6\,\Msun$ remnant, but also because they eschew the use of an $\alpha$-viscosity and instead directly evolve the magnetic field of the merger remnant.  Since we have not performed our own post-merger evolution simulations\footnote{We experimented with \flash-based 2.5D simulations, but did not follow up with a detailed investigation.}, we use \cite{schw+12} and \cite{ji+13}'s results extensively throughout this thesis - in particular, we reconsidered the simple estimate made in Sec. \ref{ssec:ch2_viscevo_possiblespindown} using \cite{ji+13}'s results when preparing \citeal{zhu+16}.  Since this thesis has no dedicated chapter on post-merger evolution, we expand and update the discussion in Sec. \ref{ssec:ch2_viscevo_possiblespindown} below.

%\cite{shen+12} flesh out the further evolution of \cite{dan+11}'s $0.6 -0.9\,\Msun$ dissimilar-mass merger.  They first use a 1D Lagrangian hydrodynamic simulator with a $\gamma = 5/3$ polytropic equation of state to evolve the (height-integrated) remnant surface density profile under the influence of a uniform $\alpha = 10^{-2}$ viscosity prescription.  This $\alpha$ value is chosen so the system evolves over $t_\mrm{visc} \sim 10^{4}\,\mrm{s}$, roughly consistent with the viscosity arising from either the magnetorotational instability (MRI; \citealt{balbh91}) or (in region where its onset is unfavourable) the Tayler-Spruit dyanamo (eg. \citealt{spru02}).  Material inside of $M_\mrm{enc} = 0.9\,\Msun$ is assumed to remain unchanged.  Note that $\alpha$ is likely to be non-uniform in space and time, as, for example, the Tayler-Spruit dynamo viscosity will not be identical to that of the MRI, but \cite{shen+12} argue this will only change the details of the evolution -- the qualitative results remain unchanged so long as the viscous timescale falls between the dynamical and thermal ones.  They find -- as expected from viscous evolution -- evolution toward a shear-free solid body rotation, with the sub-Keplerian disk converted to a thermally supported, near-virial, tenuous atmosphere.  This atmosphere ($\rho \lesssim 10^4\,\gcc$, $T \sim 10^9\,\mrm{K}$) is radiation-dominated, and so has a near-Eddington luminosity.  

%  Since the $0.6 - 0.9\,\Msun$ merger has a cold core with little rotational support, the loss of this support does not heat it substantially; the hottest point in the remnant is instead a ``hot ring'' residing at the boundary between the $0.9\,\Msun$ accretor and disrupted donor material, formed by shock-heated donor material falling onto the accretor.

%\cite{schw+12} replace \cite{shen+12}'s Lagrangian solver with the \textsc{ZEUS-MP2} \citep{haye+06} Eulerian hydrodynamics code, modified with the Helmholtz \citep{timms00} equation of state, a stress-tensor term with a dynamic viscosity coefficient given by $\alpha = 3\times10^{-2}$ ($\alpha = 10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ lead to qualitatively similar end results) and a simplified five-isotope nuclear network.  They simulate eight dissimilar-mass merger remnants (from \citealt{dan+11}), including two CO-CO ones, and confirm \cite{shen+12}'s qualitative results, most notably that a combination of spin-down and viscous heating converts the rotationally-supported outer layers of the remnant to a spherically symmetric, thermally-supported and convectively unstable hot atmosphere.  For their fiducial $0.6 - 0.9\,\Msun$, spin-down increases the hot ring's temperature by a factor of $\sim1.5$, and density by a factor of $\sim3$, enough to push it above the carbon ignition line.  The other remnants they consider are either remnants of He-CO mergers with extreme mass ratios, those of low-mass He-He mergers, or massive, $\gtrsim1.7\,\Msun$ ones.  The results of these systems are very similar to their fiducial one, except for the contribution of He nuclear burning to the temperature structure of the spun-down remnant for He-CO remnants.

\cite{ji+13} implements their magnetohydrodynamic simulation using the \flash\ Eulerian code \citep{fryx+00} and with the $0.6 - 0.6\,\Msun$ remnant of \citeal{loreig09} for initial conditions.  Like \cite{schw+12}, they utilize a 2.5D axisymmetric grid, where a 2D grid extends along $\hat{r}$ and $\hat{z}$ (\cite{schw+12} use a $\hat{r}-\hat{\theta}$ spherical grid instead), while $\hat{\phi}$ quantities remain constant for all $\phi$, and the Helmholtz EOS.  Since \citeal{loreig09}'s remnants are unmagnetized, they artificially insert a purely poloidal magnetic field whose strength is $\sim10^8\,\mrm{G}$ and varies with density in the remnant disk and is damped to $\lesssim10^5\,\mrm{G}$in the core and hot envelope (they find their results to be robust to changing initial field strength and spatial resolution by factors of 2).  They advance their simulation to $2\times10^4\,\mrm{s}$, comparable to the end times in \cite{schw+12}.  They find that MRI in the differentially rotation parts of the remnant grows the field over several hundred seconds, saturating with a peak strength of $\sim10^9\,\mrm{G}$ in the disk and $\gtrsim10^{10}\,\mrm{G}$ in the core, as well as a total magnetic energy of $\sim10^{48}\,\mrm{erg}$, on part with the differential rotation energy of the system (\citeal{zhu+15}).  While the field produces Maxwell stress (very roughly equivalent to $\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$), leading to global outward angular momentum transport as in \cite{schw+12}, it also generates a hot magnetized corona heated by magnetically buoyant disk material, and a binconal outflow along the remnant's rotational axis.  These outflows eject $10^{-3}\,\Msun$ of material at roughly twice the local escape velocity (of $\sim1600\,\mrm{km}\psec$).  

Much like \cite{schw+12}, the entire remnant loses rotational support (though it has not fully spun-down -- $\Omegac \approx 0.15\,\psec$ at the end of their simulation) and evolves toward a spherically symmetric state with a dense, degenerately supported and more tenuous thermally supported material.  By the end of the simulation $\sim0.08\,\Msun$ of material either resides in the magnetically dominated corona or is outfluxed from the simulation domain, leaving $1.12\,\Msun$ remaining in the remnant -- though this does not distinguish between the core and envelope.  Accretion onto and loss of rotational support within the core leads to its center being compressionally heated by a factor of $\sim3$ in density and $\sim2$ in temperature.  As their initial conditions are a factor of $\sim2$ hotter than our equivalent $0.6 - 0.6\,\Msun$ remnant (Sec. \ref{ssec:c2_compwithloreig}), this additional compression ignites central nuclear fusion.

How do \cite{ji+13}'s results, alongside \cite{schw+12}'s, compare to our simple estimates of viscous evolution in Sec. \ref{ssec:ch2_viscevo_possiblespindown}?  The most relevant quantities needed for our purposes are the density and temperature at the center and at the hottest point of the post-viscous remnant, to determine whether carbon fusion ignites under highly degenerate conditions, and the amount of material that remains a part of the dense, degeneracy-dominated remnant core.  The latter is important for comparing against simmering WDs in Chapter \ref{ch:ch6}.  As previously noted, we estimate the base of the hot envelope of our $0.6-0.9\,\Msun$ increases by a factor of $2.5$ in density and $1.6$ in temperature, very similar to \cite{schw+12}'s results.  The central density of their remnant is $1.75\times10^7\,\gcc$ at the start of viscous evolution \citep{dan+11} and $2.8\times10^7\,\gcc$ at the end -- an factor of $1.6$ increase, while we find a factor of $2.0$.  We tend to estimate much larger amounts of compressional heating for similar-mass systems, finding the $0.6 - 0.6\,\Msun$ increases its central density and temperature by a factor of $6.6$ and $2.7$, respectively.  These are substantially larger than the $2.5$ and $1.9$, respectively, that \cite{ji+13} find.  This is likely due to two factors: first, our simple estimate assumes all rotational energy is deposited as heat solely in the outermost regions of the remnant, while in reality similar-mass remnants are rotationally supported throughout and thus will likely also be heated throughout during viscous evolution, reducing the amount of core compression.  Second, \cite{ji+13}'s remnant also has not fully lost core rotational support at the end of their simulation.\footnote{\cite{ji+13} additionally note the central temperature at the end of evolution has not converged, increasing by $\sim20$\% with spatial resolution.}  There are unfortunately no other systems we can directly compare to, since these are the only systems we have in come with either \cite{schw+12} or \cite{ji+13}.  We are, however, able to use more of \cite{schw+12}'s results to determine the mass of the post-viscous core. 

% The central density of schw+12's 0.6 - 0.9Msun remnant comes from Table 1 of dan+11; the spun-down value comes from Table 3 of schw+12.  For the 0.6 - 0.6 system, we use the central term in the xy-plane temperature-density relationship ("crho" and "cT" if using GitHubTemp/PaperRunaway/papercalc_other.py) rather than the max values.

In our simple estimate, the mass of the post-viscous core, \Mcpv, is given by the mass of the spherically symmetric hydrostatic model representing the spun-down remnant (Sec. \ref{ssec:ch2_viscevo_possiblespindown}).  In Fig. \ref{fig:c2a_mcpvvsmtot}, we plot this mass versus the total mass of the merging binary, finding that to first order

\eqbegin
\Mcpv = .
\label{eq:c2a_mfit}
\eqend

\noindent For \cite{schw+12}, \Mcpv\ can be estimated from the combined mass of the core and isothermal region ($M_\mrm{c} + M_\mrm{tp}$ in their Table 3); for \cite{ji+13}, we integrate the spherical density profile of the end-state of their simulation (Suoqing Ji and Robert Fisher private communication) to $r = 2\times10^9\,\mrm{cm}$.  We find that these values tend to be below Eqn. \ref{eq:c2a_mfit} by $\sim0.05\,\Msun$.  Therefore our simple estimate overall does roughly produce the amount of mass remaining in the post-viscous core, and the amount of compressional heating the core experiences.(at least for dissimilar mass systems) attached to the degenerate core following spin down, but in detail tends to overestimate both effects.  As noted above, the largest cause of this discrepancy is likely to be our assumption of zero heating in the remnant core, which explains why our estimates tend to work better for dissimilar-mass mergers.

For those systems that do not ignite nuclear fusion during the viscous phase, their next stage of evolution involves entropy being transported by radiative diffusion away from the remnant interior to its outer regions, and eventually away from the remnant entirely as radiation.  Since the remnant hot envelope ($\rho \lesssim 10^4\,\gcc$, $T \sim 10^9\,\mrm{K}$) is radiation-dominated, it has a near-Eddington luminosity, and thermal evolution will occur over a timescale \citep{shen+12}

\eqbegin
t_\mrm{therm} \sim E_\mrm{th, envelope}/L_\mrm{edd} \sim 10^4\,\mrm{yr}.
\eqend

\noindent For those systems that do ignite fusion, the nuclear runaway time is $\sim10^3\,\mrm{yr}$, so this evolution will only occur to a very limited extent.  \cite{shen+12} simulate their $0.6-0.9\,\Msun$ remnant's thermal evolution in the \mesa\ \citep{paxt+11} 1D quasi-hydrostatic stellar evolution code.  Due to their viscous code using flattened cylindrical coordinates, they cannot directly port its output into \mesa, and instead evolve an artificial stellar profile that approximates the post-viscous remnant.  Notably, the peak temperature at the base of the hot envelope is below the carbon ignition line.  They find the entropy from the remnant interior diffuses outward over $\sim10^4\,\mrm{yr}$, leading to the further compression and heating of the interior.  After $\sim6000\,\mrm{yr}$, carbon fusion ignites at the (non-degenerate) base of the envelope (at $m \sim 0.9\,\Msun$), though \cite{shen+12} note this is dependent on their (artificial) initial conditions.  Whenever it is ignited, the nuclear burning zone will stably convert carbon into oxygen and neon, and will diffuse into the remnant interior over $10^4\,\mrm{yr}$.  Meanwhile, convection rapidly redistributes entropy to much of the envelope, expanding the envelope until its photosphere reaches $10^{12}-10^{13}\,\mrm{cm}$, comparable to giant stars.  

\cite{shen+12} predict that their remnant will be fully converted into an ONe WD, much like in earlier calculations of near-Eddington accretion onto massive WDs (eg. \citeal{saion85}), and since its total mass is marginally above \Mch, its final fate, as it compresses further, may be an accretion-induced collapse.  The radiation-dominated envelope alongside the remnant's carbon-oxygen composition, however, suggest that the remnant drives strong winds.  \cite{ji+13} also find that much of the remnant envelope volume (though not mass) becomes marginally magnetic pressure-dominated ($B^2/8\pi P_\mrm{gas} \sim 1$), and that the remnant magnetically drives bipolar outflows.  Substantial mass loss during thermal evolution is therefore likely, complicating the thermal evolution and potentially preventing an AIC.  Magnetic coupling between the outflow and the remnant will aid in its spindown and possibly generate non-local heating through magnetic resistivity.

% Shen+12 gives the escape velocity at 10^13 cm as 60 km/s.  Given 10^4 years of evolution, this wind could transport material to 10^18 cm, possibly explaining the variable sodium emission.

Thermal evolution of post-viscous remnants that are hottest at their \textit{center} have, to our knowledge, not yet been calculated.  We expect it would be qualitatively similar to \cite{shen+12}'s findings for their dissimilar-mass remnant: a further compression of the interior over $\sim10^4\,\mrm{yr}$, and less heating than if the compression were adiabatic, since radiative and neutrino cooling become significant over these longer timescales.  We thus expect that systems brought to the brink of ignition by viscous spin-down may subsequently ignite due to thermal contraction, though the number of such systems is likely to be small.  Those systems whose central temperatures are significantly below $6\times10^8\,\mrm{K}$ will cool too much during their compression to ignite, and, since neutrino cooling is density-dependent, may experience off-center ignition instead.
